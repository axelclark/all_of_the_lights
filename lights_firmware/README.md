# LightsFirmware

## Targets

Nerves applications produce images for hardware targets based on the
`MIX_TARGET` environment variable. If `MIX_TARGET` is unset, `mix` builds an
image that runs on the host (e.g., your laptop). This is useful for executing
logic tests, running utilities, and debugging. Other targets are represented by
a short name like `rpi3` that maps to a Nerves system image for that platform.
All of this logic is in the generated `mix.exs` and may be customized. For more
information about targets see:

## Getting Started

On the GrovePi+ or GrovePi Zero, connect a relay switch to port D3.  The relay
switch should be connected to the light power cord.

To start this Nerves app:
  * `cd lights_firmware`  If necessary, to build firmware from this directory.
  * `export MIX_TARGET=my_target` or prefix every command with
    `MIX_TARGET=my_target`. For example, `MIX_TARGET=rpi3`
  * `export NERVES_NETWORK_SSID=my_wifi` WiFi Network
  * `export NERVES_NETWORK_PSK=secret` WiFi Password
  * `export NERVES_HOST="192.168.0.000"` Host needed for channels handshake.
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create firmware with `mix firmware`
  * Burn to an SD card with `mix firmware.burn`
